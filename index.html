        It all started in Kiev, Ukraine. Tolu originally lived in Ivano-Frankivisk, 
          Ukraine (Western Ukraine) while Ade lived in Kiev (the capital, North-central Ukraine).
          You can see the distance.
        
          Tolu’s parent happened to have come to visit her younger brother and herself. 
          And on the day they boarded their flight back to Nigeria was the day of the divine connection.
          That faithful evening, on a normal day
          he won’t come to KFC - his routine was work and home. He was there to meet a friend and treat him as well. 
          And as for her, she was a regular customer at KFC whenever she’s at Kiev. </p>

      <h1>The Greatest Love </h1>
    
    <p>
      “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” in John 15:13 (NKJV). He did exactly that for you and me.</p>
      <p>If you lived a whole life to be recognized by men, to be famous and have all that money could buy, but you’re yet to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ by you declaring with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you’d have lived an empty life. </p>
      <p>Jesus said in Mark 8:36, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”</p>
      
      <h1>Prayer of Salvation</h1>
      
     <p> We invite you to make Jesus Christ the Lord of your life by praying this simple prayer now!</p>
      
      <p>“O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I believe He’s alive today. I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day. Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again. Thank you Lord, for saving my soul! I’m now a child of God. Hallelujah!”</p>
      
      <p>Congratulations! You are now a child of God. We want to send you ministry resources of Christ Embassy to help you grow as a Christian.</p>
